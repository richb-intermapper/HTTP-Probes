\GB\Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS - Follow Redirects)\P\

The protocol used to transfer web pages on the World Wide Web, defined in \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2068.txt\RFC 2068\P0\ and \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt\RFC 1945\P0\. The default TCP port number for HTTPS connections is port 443.

This TCP probe lets you download a specific web page and scan it for a specific string of HTML. This probe will follow a limited number of page redirects to the same HTTPS server.

\i\Host Name\p\ is the domain name of the web server (e.g. "www.intermapper.com"). This can be derived from the host name part of the URL that you want to test. You must enter a valid "Host Name" to test web servers which implement virtual hosts. Only enter an IP address or domain name; do not add "https://".

\i\URL Path\p\ is the full path of the desired file on the web server (e.g. "/index.html"). This can be empty to get to the root page of the site.

\i\String to verify\p\ is a string to verify in the data returned by the web server.  For example, if you are retrieving a web page, you might search for "<HTML" or "<P>" to verify that the data is HTML. If this string is not found, the device will go into alarm.

\i\User ID\p\ is the user name typed into the web browser's password dialog. The default is to leave this blank. You should set this parameter if you want to test a web page that requires authentication.

\i\Password\p\ is the password for the web browser's dialog. The default is to leave this blank. You should set this parameter if you want to test a web page that requires authentication.

\i\Redirect Limit\p\ is the maximum number of redirects to follow.
