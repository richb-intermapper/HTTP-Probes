HTTP-Probes
===========

HTTP Probes for InterMapper. 
These probes have been modified from the built-in set of probes from IM 5.6 to include:

* Clickable URLs in the status window that lead to the page being tested
* Consistent &lt;description> fields
* URL Path parameter can include optional leading "/" (it was required in 5.6 probes)
